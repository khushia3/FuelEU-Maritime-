# Fuel EU Assignment - Minimal Submission

This archive contains a minimal but functional scaffold for the Fuel EU dashboard:
- /backend: Node.js + TypeScript (in-memory) implementing core endpoints
- /frontend: React + Vite + TypeScript (minimal UI using Tailwind directives in CSS)

How to run:
1. Backend: cd backend && npm install && npm run dev
2. Frontend: cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev
3. Open http://localhost:5173 (or Vite's port)

This is a scaffold intended to demonstrate architecture and working endpoints. Fill in tests, ESLint, and production DB in next iteration.
